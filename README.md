# Predicting-Air-Pollution-in-Madrid

I went to Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech) where I took a **machine learning masters course** ,  among others. 
The objective of this project was to predict the pollution levels of the 4 main pollutants in the city of Madrid: 

* Sulphur dioxide (SO2) 
* Ozone (O3) 
* Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 
* Particulate matter (PM10)

The daily historic data of the pollutants is open for everyone on Madrid's town hall website (https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob). After analyzing the data, I developed 3 different machine learning models: Linear Regression, Triple exponential smoothing, Long short-term memory (LSTM).

The best machine learning model to solve the problem was the deep learning one, Long short-term memory (LSTM).

In the PDF (iti8586_Rodrigo_Lallana_project.pdf) I describe in detail the data and the three different approaches.
